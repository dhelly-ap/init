# init
This project was the first one to discover system and network basic commands, many of the services used on a server machine, as well as a few ideas of scripts that can be useful for SysAdmins on a daily basis.

# Parts

The part 1 “Network” was done on local shell (zsh). 

The part 2 and 3, “System” and “Scripting”was done on a Debian virtual machine
